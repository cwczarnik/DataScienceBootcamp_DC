# This is a compilation repository of projects/challenges from a data science bootcamp textbook of challenges. 
# Some challenges are more complete, and will hopefully include the prompt, the code, the analysis, and written analysis of insight and impact.

The challenges represent real data sets and business structures and serve as practice and exposure to different data types and data structures. 

I'll list them out when they are complete.
