    "- Build a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent or not. Explain how different assumptions about the cost of false positives vs false negatives would impact the model.\n",
    "- Your boss is a bit worried about using a model she doesn't understand for something as important as fraud detection. How would you explain her how the model is making the predictions? Not from a mathematical perspective (she couldn't care less about that), but from a user perspective. What kinds of users are more likely to be classified as at risk? What are their characteristics?\n",
    "- Let's say you now have this model which can be used live to predict in real time if an activity is fraudulent or not. From a product perspective, how would you use it? That is,what kind of different user experiences would you build based on the model output?"
